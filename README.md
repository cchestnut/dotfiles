Dotfiles
========
A compliation of my OSX dotfiles including an installation script.

Usage
-----
To install all components, as well as a small selection of required packages run

  - git clone http://github.com/csherland/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles && ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

The script may require confirmation for a few installations, but otherwise, thats
all that is required for installation.
